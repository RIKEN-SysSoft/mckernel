      "message": "That took me really a long time to understand, because I thought it meant \"in mckernel we compute phys_to_virt() differently than linux (on purpose)\" while it means \"fix phys_to_virt() to compute the same as linux\".\nPlease update this to something like \"arm64: fix phys_to_virt() calculation to be the same as linux\" or anything to that intent.\n\nAlso a reference to what PHYS_OFFSET/PAGE_OFFSET on arm (e.g. linux\u0027s Documentation/arm/Porting) mean might help; it\u0027s a bit late to rename arm64_st_phys_base but we might as well explain things a bit somewhere... commit messages are a good start.",
