      "message": "I like how charstat[] is built better now, but you\u0027re opening up the possibility of having holes in the array now so this should print something like `charstat[rc] ? : \"Unknown\"` to be safe.\n\nThis kind of initialization guarantees you will have NULL if rc is before the last index, so you do not need to check rc \u003e\u003d IHK_OS_STATUS_NOT_BOOTED with this (but still need to check it is positive, which is the same in practice now but not in intent as order might change)\n\nAdditionally for further future-proofing we should add a last element to the enum e.g. IHK_OS_STATUS_COUNT or whatever delimiter and use that instead of HUNGUP here + define it as NULL explicitely in the array; but since that\u0027s in ihk repo I won\u0027t insist on this, only do if you want to/have time.",
