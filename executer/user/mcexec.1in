.SH NAME
mcexec \- run an application on McKernel
.\"

.\" ----------------------------  SYNOPSIS ----------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mcexec \fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fR [\fI<mcos-id>\fR] \fI<command>\fR

.\" ----------------------------  DESCRIPTION ----------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
mcexec executes \fI<command>\fR on McKernel.  If <mcos-id> is
specified, the command is executed on the McKernel instance associated
with \fI<mcos-id>\fR.  Usually, this number is omitted. The options
are described below.

.\" ----------------------------  DESCRIPTION ----------------------------
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B	-n N
Specify the number of MPI ranks run on the node when using MPI (except Fujitsu MPI).
For example,
.br
   $ mpirun -n 32 -ppn 4 mcexec -n 4 ./a.out
.br
the ./a.out program runs on eight nodes each of
which has four processes.
You must specify this option when using MPI (except Fujitsu MPI).
Undefined behavior entails if not.

.TP
.B	-t N
Specify the number of syscall threads in the proxy process. If this
option is omitted and the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment is specified,
the OMP_NUM_THREADS value is used. Otherwise, the number of syscall
threads equals to the number of CPU cores assigned to McKernel.

.\".TP
.\".B	-c N
.\"Specify the target CPU core on which the application to be run.  Do
.\"not specify this option with -n or with -t.

.TP
.B	-h N, --extend-heap-by=N
Specify the size of heap extension by the brk() system call.
The default size is 4K Byte. \fIN\fR accepts the following format:
.br
.RS 10
<digits>{k|K|m|M|g|G}
.br
e.g.: 10k means 10Kibyte, 100M 100Mibyte, 1G 1Gibyte
.RE
.RS 7

In certain applications, such as miniFE, specifying "-h 12M" improves
performance.
.RE

.TP
.B	-s P,[M], --stack-premap=P,[M]
Pre-map \fIP\fR bytes of stack when creating a process. 2Mibyte is
used when not specified. And set the max size of stack to \fIM\fR
bytes. Both of them accept the following format:
.br
.RS 10
<digits>{k|K|m|M|g|G}
.br
e.g.: 10k means 10Kibyte, 100M 100Mibyte, 1G 1Gibyte
.RE

.TP
.B	--profile
Enable system call profiling. After the execution, profiling
information may be obtained by the ihkosctl tool.

.TP
.B	--mpol-no-heap, --mpol-no-stack, --mpol-no-bss, 
Disregard NUMA memory policy in the heap/stack/BSS areas.
In case of Flat Memory and Quadrant clustering modes on the Xeon Phi
(KNL), two NUMA nodes, i.e., DDR and MCDRAM, are available.
The following example in Linux enforces that all memory is allocated
from NUMA #1, i.e., MCDRAM.
      $ numactl -m 1 ./a.out
In the following example, memory is allocated in MCDRAM except for the
stack area. That is, the stack area is allocated in the nearest memory
of thread/process, i.e., DDR.
     $ mcexec --mpol-no-stack numactl -m 1 ./a.out

.TP
.B	--mpol-shm-premap
Prepopulate shared memory region of the Intel MPI library.
This option eliminates potential kernel resource contention by
avoiding page faults in the shared memory region.

.TP
.B	-m N, --mpol-threshold=N
Specify the threshold of memory size for respecting the memory
allocation policy in NUMA machines. If the size of memory allocation
is smaller than the one specified in this option, the memory area is
allocated from the nearest memory of the thread/process disregarding
the user specified NUMA policy.

.TP
.B	--disable-sched-yield
Disable the sched yield system call. It is useful if the number of
processes and threads are no more than the number of cores and thus
explicit scheduling is not required.  This option changes the
LD_PRELOAD environment variable on McKernel, and thus the LD_PRELOAD
value is not taken over.

.TP
.B	--no-bind-ikc-map
Do not affinitize proxy processes to the IKC target CPUs.

The following options will be deprecated.
.TP
.B	--disable-vdso
disable the vdso feature. You should not specify this option.

.B	--enable-vdso
enable the vdso feature. The default is enable.

.\" ----------------------------  ENVIRONMENT ----------------------------
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B	MCKERNEL_RLIMIT_STACK
If this variable exists, its value is set to the RLIMIT_STACK
environment variable on Mckernel.
.TP
.B	MCKERNEL_LD_PRELOAD
The LD_PRELOAD envirnoment variable in Linux is not taken over by McKernel.
Instead, if this variable exists, its value is set to the LD_PRELOAD
environment variable on McKernel. If the --disable-sched-yield option
is specified in mcexec, LD_PRELOAD defined by the user is not
effective in this release.
