      "message": "This is tricky, because this rusage.h is included from both linux (which doesn\u0027t have arch_rusage, but includes ihklib_rusage) and mckernel.\n\nWorse than being a problem of style, this allows different definitions of IHK_MAX_NUM_PGSIZES on both sides leading to runtime problems with a successful build (like now); x86\u0027s arch_rusage and ihklib rusage don\u0027t agree on the count. The ihklib rusage really needs to be the same arch-dependent enum... Or could we just define all of the possible values in both case and get rid of this somehow?",
