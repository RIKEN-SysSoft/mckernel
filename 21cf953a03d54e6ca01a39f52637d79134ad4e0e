      "message": "(discussed orally) seems I missed this mount recursive ROOTFSDIR, I can add it back for now under the ifdef protection.\n\nI still think it\u0027s a very bad idea to allow this ioctl that will blindly mount anything anywhere, it\u0027s trivial to make something mounted over /etc/shadow and get root; having some sort of setuid mcexec mount helper that would mount bind only a few key files/directories (hardcoded at compile time, and careful not to overwrite e.g. /etc or libc...) is probably the most sensible thing to do.\nOr just move this all to the softoverlay code that only the process under mcexec would be affected?",
