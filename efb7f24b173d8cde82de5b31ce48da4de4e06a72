      "message": "hmm, how is it supposed to work if an application really relies on setfsuid to work?\nIf I understand the issue here, with our design, there is no guarantee that a mckernel thread doing:\n - setfsuid(x);\n - open(y);\n\nwill have the open() really happen in the mcexec thread that did the setfsuid......\n\nIt\u0027s not reasonable to match 1-1 mcexec threads vs. mckernel threads for performance reason so I think it\u0027s actually more reasonable to say we do not support setfsuid/setfsgid and not try to work around issues for them.\nHonestly, setfsuid/setfsgid have little to do with HPC, I think we should just say no.",
